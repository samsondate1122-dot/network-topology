# LAN Class Network Simulation (Cisco Packet Tracer)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a **Local Area Network (LAN)** setup created during class using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.  
The simulation shows how multiple computers can be interconnected through networking devices to communicate effectively.

## ⚙️ Steps Taken
1. Added **Switches, PCs, and Routers** into the workspace.  
2. Connected the devices using **copper straight-through cables**.  
3. Assigned **IP addresses** to each PC.  
4. Verified connectivity using the `ping` command between PCs.

## ✅ Learning Outcomes
- Understanding how a **LAN** is built in Packet Tracer.  
- Hands-on with **basic device connections** (Switches, Routers, PCs).  
- IP addressing and testing with **ping**.  
- Documenting networking projects with **GitHub**.
